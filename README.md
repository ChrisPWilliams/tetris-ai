# tetris-ai
Tetris ai work using tensorflow: aim to use dqn to learn tetris (deprecated code for a supervised learning approach is also archived here)

Dependencies: Tensorflow, tf-agents, pygame. Don't know if github clones conda environment setup and pip package management, if so it should prompt installation of the required versions of these packages.
